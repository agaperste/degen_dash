Realized capitalization for $degen (https://warpcast.com/ilemi/0xdfad1f0e)

- what is realized cap for Bitcoin UTXO model: https://academy.glassnode.com/market/realized-capitalization#
    - measure the value of a cryptocurrency's supply in a manner that accounts for the actual price at which each unit last moved
    1. Identify the Last Transaction Price for Each Unit
    2. Multiply Each Unit by Its Last Transaction Price
    3. Sum Up the Realized Values
- however, $degen is an ERC20 fungible token, so we can't track each individual units like we do for Bitcoin
- instead, as Julian proposed, we will ** track and calculate the realized cap on a per user, i.e., wallet address level **
    - doing it the ** virtual UTXO ** way proposed here by CoinMetric https://coinmetrics.io/realized-capitalization/
    - each incoming payment creates a new coin attached to the account, the coin is valued at the price of the movement
    - each outgoing payment triggers a coin selection on the coins attached to the account, the change is valued at the current market price
    - the coin selection weâ€™ll use is largest coins first
